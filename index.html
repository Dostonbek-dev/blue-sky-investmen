            <p>
                And so friends, as you could already understand, today we will talk about who this mysterious person is hiding behind the word trader.
                If you look for information on the
                Internet, it says that a trader is a
                trader who acts on his own initiative and seeks to profit directly
                from the trading process.</p>
            <p id="dots"></p>
            <p id="more">
                From my own experience, I can say that a trader is a bridge between an investor and an exchange. The goal of a trader is first of all to help the investor earn money, and only then to earn money himself.
                At first glance, people who are not versed in this direction may think that the profession is very easy. What's so hard about that they think they sit at the computer for a couple of hours pressing the buttons and the money itself flows into the pockets. I hasten to upset you as it only seems at first glance.
                Trading is primarily about controlling your emotions. If you are short-tempered or lack patience, you will not be successful in trading. Secondly, it is the ability to analyze the current situation in the world and on the stock exchange. You need to be able to structure a lot of information.
                And it's not for nothing that they say that trading is an intellectual sport.</p>

            WHO IS A TRADER AND WHAT DOES HE DO?</h1>
        <p>

            A lot of such questions are asked to us and our team “Who is a trader? What does he do ”, and today we decided to share our view on this mysterious word.
            A trader in translation from English is a trader in the broadest sense of the word. The profession of a trader is very specific and does not require a diploma in economics. Anyone can become a trader, but desire alone is not enough to be successful. You must have a special predisposition and constantly improve. You are competing with the best of the best,
            and the only indicator of a trader's performance is the exchange yield.
            Those unfamiliar with the specifics of working in the financial market believe that a trader earns fabulous money in the shortest possible time. That one has only to learn to "read stock charts", master simple trading techniques, read a couple of books about trading, and a couple of million in your pocket!

            In fact, this is a delusion that has nothing to do with reality. A trader can take losses for half a year, and then cover all the failures with a series of brilliant trades.

            <h1>TIPS FOR BEGINNING TRADERS</h1>
            <p>Friends, today my team and I decided to share a couple of tips for novice traders.
                Attraction of the amount that you are ready to lose.
                In the forex market, there is such an unspoken pattern that a novice trader always loses
                (in the trader's slang - “drains”) his first deposit. This is due to the fact that a beginner
                in trading financial instruments does not yet have all the necessary trading skills and
                <br>
                <span style="margin-top: 4px">18.02.2021</span>
            <p id="dot3"></p>
            <p id="more3">
                trading psychology. Some forex brokers offer their clients to open a so-called cent account, which will allow them to start trading with real money with an amount of $ 1-10.
                Self-control and trading psychology.
                Professional traders know what the psychology of a trader is. Newcomers to the forex market should learn to control their emotions, fight fear and be more decisive. However, at the same time, you should be careful and act according to the established rules, and sometimes you just need to wait.
                Demo account
                Every professional trader started his trading path by trading on a demo account. Demo account - a virtual account that is provided by a broker for training on testing the trading system. Thanks to the demo account, a novice trader can acquire practical skills in trading in financial markets without the risk of losing real money.
                Professional traders advice: study on a demo account until your trading strategy starts to bring a stable profit.
